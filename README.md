# Dust-Buster
The dust buster was a team project made by 4 members - Joshni, Kiruthika, Lakshmi and I for our First Year Science Day Project Expo. The idea started with a simple 3d printed chalk box as we found our college lacking them. 
The prototype of our project featured old metal boxes aimed at Goal 9 of Sustainable Development Goals: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure: Building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation.
